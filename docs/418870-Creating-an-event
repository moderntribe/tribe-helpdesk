<p>This is actually really easy. Let's start in the WordPress dashboard - you should be able to find a menu entry called <em>Events</em> and, if you click on it, you should see the <em>Add New</em> link.</p>

<p><img alt="Showing the Add New item within the Events menu" src="https://s3.theeventscalendar.com/uploads/2014/12/add-event-665x574.png" /></p>

<p>Once you've found it, go ahead and click on it! This should bring you to the event editor.</p>

<p>The event editor hopefully won't contain too many surprises: it is intentionally almost identical - at least on first glance - to the regular page and post editor used by WordPress itself.</p>

<p>Just as with a page or post, you can add a title and description to your event. The expected controls for saving it as a draft or publishing it are present, too:</p>

<p><img alt="Screenshot showing the event editor in action" src="https://s3.theeventscalendar.com/uploads/2014/10/create-event-event-editor.png" /></p>

<p>So, if you're familiar with WordPress, you should feel right at home.</p>

<h4>Event Time</h4>

<p>Of course, events have specific bits of information associated with them that most pages and posts don't require - start and end dates, for instance, not to mention venues and organizers.</p>

<p>Fields to set all of these things can be found below the description editor, in an area called the <em>events meta box</em>:</p>

<p><img alt="Extra event options found in the event editor" src="https://s3.theeventscalendar.com/uploads/2014/12/create-event-events-meta-box-top-half2.png" /></p>

<p>Let's look at each of the settings in this area in turn. First, the date and time fields.</p>

<ul>
	<li>The <strong>Start/End</strong> - this is simply when the event starts and finishes. Clicking into either date field will pop up a date picker, where you may select your desired dates from a calendar. Event start and end times may be selected from a drop-down menu, or you may enter your dates and times manually if you prefer. If you already checked the <em>All Day Event</em> box you will not be able to specify a time for your event</li>
	<li>The <strong>All Day Event </strong>checkbox is useful when the event is taking place on a particular date (or dates) - but you don't really know when, or else feel that it is good enough to say it takes place "all day" without being more specific</li>
</ul>

<p>The above covers creating a singular, non-recurring event that is not part of a series. If you need help creating a PRO recurring event using the <strong>Event Series</strong> option, you'll want to read through <a href="867204-Importing-Data-from-a-CSV-File">our walkthrough tutorial</a> on recurring events.</p>

<h4>Event Venue</h4>

<p><img alt="Event location (venue) section of the event data meta box" src="https://s3.theeventscalendar.com/uploads/2014/12/create-event-location-venue-details3.png" /></p>

<p>If this is your first time using The Events Calendar, you'll see this list of fields for creating your first event venue. If you've created a venue for a previous event, you'll have the option of selecting an existing venue from a drop-down menu (you may also type into the search box to narrow your options). Entering a new venue name and selecting the <strong>Create</strong> option from the menu options will display the new venue form fields below, allowing you to create a new venue for your event.</p>

<p><img alt="Drop-down menu in event location (venue) section for selecting existing venue" src="https://s3.theeventscalendar.com/uploads/2014/12/create-event-location-venue-details-existing.png" /></p>

<p>It's also worth noting that you <strong>don't need to create (or use) a venue.</strong> If you prefer not to specify a venue, simply move on to the next section.</p>

<p>Provide a name for the venue and any optional address details - if you like - a contact phone number and website. The last two checkboxes control whether a map should be shown to visitors and/or a link to a map should be displayed.</p>

<p>💡 If your event is happening a little off the beaten path and there isn't a mappable address, <strong>you can use latitude and longitude instead</strong>. To do this, leave the venue without an address. After you've created the event, go to <strong>Events &gt; Venues</strong> and edit the Venue in question. You'll see an option there for adding coordinates.?</p>

<p>Once you're happy with the event's venue you can move on to the next section: the organizer details.</p>

<h4>Organizers</h4>

<p>Rather like the venue details, you can select any pre-existing organizer details that you have already entered. Also - just as with the venue details - this area is completely optional.</p>

<p><img alt="KB - new event organizer" src="https://s3.theeventscalendar.com/uploads/2014/12/KB-new-event-organizer2.png" /></p>

<p>You do not need to provide organizer details and, if you do, you need only provide as much information as you want to. With The Events Calendar 3.11+, you can add multiple organizers to an event. Keep in mind that if you opt for multiple organizers, any organizer meta (like the phone number or email) will <em>not </em>show on the frontend- only the organizer names will be listed. If you have Events Calendar PRO, the listed names will link to the associated <a href="750833-Venue-and-Organizer-pages">Organizer Page</a>.</p>

<h4>Event Website</h4>

<p>The next section in the New Event Admin lets you (again, optionally) provide an event website:</p>

<p><img alt="Event website field within the event meta box" src="https://s3.theeventscalendar.com/uploads/2014/10/create-event-event-website.png" /></p>

<p>This is particularly useful if you are showcasing events organized by external organizations and they have a dedicated event website.</p>

<h4>Event Cost</h4>

<p><img alt="Cost fields in the event editor" src="https://s3.theeventscalendar.com/uploads/2014/10/create-event-event-cost.png" /></p>

<p>Once again you can pass on by and leave these alone if you like. If you don't provide a cost, then no cost details will be shown to visitors. If the event is actually free then simply provide a cost of 0 (zero).</p>

<p>Do also note that, in the interests of being as internationally friendly as possible, you are able to make a currency symbol display either <em>before</em> or <em>after</em> the actual amount.</p>

<p>Depending on what is installed within your WordPress site you may see additional fields and settings in this area - particularly if you have purchased and activated one of our <a href="https://theeventscalendar.com/tickets/" rel="noopener" target="_blank" title="Sell tickets with any of the leading WordPress e-commerce plugins and The Events Calendar">awesome ticketing plugins</a> - but the above fields constitute the basic settings used to define an event.</p>

<p>If <a href="https://theeventscalendar.com/product/wordpress-event-tickets/">Event Tickets</a>&nbsp;or <a href="https://theeventscalendar.com/product/wordpress-eventbrite-tickets/">Eventbrite Tickets</a> is installed and active, it will hide The Events Calendar's default Event Cost field on the wp-admin Add/Edit Event page (and the&nbsp;<a href="https://theeventscalendar.com/product/wordpress-community-events/">Community Events</a>&nbsp;Add/Edit Event form, if activated).</p>

<p>For our premium plugins, please refer to our extension: <a href="https://theeventscalendar.com/extensions/show-cost-field/" title="Display the Event Cost Field When Ticket Plugins are Installed">Display the Event Cost Field When Ticket Plugins are Installed</a> to reveal the Event Cost field.</p>

<p>For <a href="https://theeventscalendar.com/product/wordpress-event-tickets/?utm_source=crobertson&amp;utm_medium=redirect" title="Event Tickets">Event Tickets</a> RSVP tickets, use the following code in your child theme's functions.php file:</p>

<pre>
add_filter( 'tribe_events_admin_show_cost_field', '__return_true' );
</pre>

<p>Don't leave just yet, there is still lots to explore!</p>

<h4>Taxonomies</h4>

<p>Rather like regular WordPress posts you can tag events. These tags are in fact the very same tags used by WordPress itself.</p>

<p>This is a really useful feature: let's say you have some blog posts about the laws of physics and are also promoting a series of events - lectures, perhaps - about the same thing. You can tag both with a suitable term like <em>Physics</em> and help visitors to the website find not only physics-related posts but events, too!</p>

<p><img alt="Tagging meta box - identical to the post editor tag box used in regular WP posts" src="https://s3.theeventscalendar.com/uploads/2014/10/create-event-tags.png" /></p>

<p>Besides tags, you can also categorize events:</p>

<p><img alt="Event categories selection box" src="https://s3.theeventscalendar.com/uploads/2014/10/create-event-event-categories.png" /></p>

<p>It is worth emphasizing, though, that these <em>are not</em> the same family of categories as used in posts. They definitely have a very similar (in fact, identical) user interface to regular post categories - but they are in fact a distinct family of categories.</p>

<p>In other words, if you happen to have an existing category you use for blog posts, you should not expect it to appear in the list of event categories - and if it does, well, it just happens to share the same name (but isn't actually the same).</p>

<h4>Event Options</h4>

<p>Usually found close to the tag and event category meta boxes, you can find the Event Options:</p>

<p><img alt="Extra event options found in the event editor" src="https://s3.theeventscalendar.com/uploads/2014/12/create-event-per-event-options2.png" /></p>

<ul>
	<li>Sometimes you want to be able to link to an event post (by email, or directly via a menu) but would prefer it isn't included in the main event views - checking the <strong>Hide from Event Listings</strong> box accomplishes just that</li>
	<li>You might also happen to have a whole load of events taking place on the same day ... naturally, that can cause some problems in month view - and so, at least by default, no more than 3 events per day are shown in that view - selecting <strong>Sticky in Month View</strong> helps you to ensure that this event is one of the ones that <em>do</em> show. The question mark's help text reads, "When events are sticky in month view, they'll display first in the list of events shown within a given day block."</li>
	<li>The <strong>Feature Event</strong> option allows you to designate your most important events for extra emphasis on your pages. Featured events will be highlighted in event views, archives, and widgets, making it a great choice for special engagements that you'd like to have front and center.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Summary</h4>

<p>That covers most of the extra fields and settings added for events.</p>

<p>If you use other event plugins, including Events Calendar PRO, it's quite likely you will see additional items - but so long as you are familiar with all or most of the above you should have no problems creating events whenever you want.</p>

<p>Of course, if you hit any difficulties, please don't hesitate to reach out to the team over at our help desk.</p>

<p>Good luck!</p>
