<p>If you are selling tickets using the Tribe Commerce functionality in Event Tickets, order management must be done from your PayPal account. You will still be able to see all orders listed in the orders page.</p>

<p>We recommend you spend some time familiarizing yourself with Tribe Commerce and/or your chosen e-commerce plugin's ordering system, as there are some differences.</p>

<h3 id="order-process">The order process</h3>

<p><strong>Using Event Tickets Plus with an e-commerce plugin:</strong></p>

<p>Although it depends on <a href="442532-Event-Tickets-Plus-which-ecommerce-solution-is-right-for-you">your e-commerce plugin</a>, the general order process for Event Tickets Plus is as follows:</p>

<ul>
	<li>A customer purchases one or more tickets</li>
	<li>An order or purchase record is created</li>
	<li>You review the order, and, if you're happy with it, you mark the order <em>Complete</em></li>
	<li>The moment the order is completed, tickets are generated and emailed out to the customer</li>
	<li>At the same time, ticket details are added to the attendee list for the event (or other post type)</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Using Event Tickets and Tribe Commerce functionality:</strong></p>

<ul>
	<li>A customer selects one or more tickets and is redirected to PayPal Checkout</li>
	<li>The customer makes a payment and an order is generated in PayPal</li>
	<li>PayPal sends the order information to your site using Instant Payment Notification system (IPN)</li>
	<li>The order information is registered and the attendee records generated</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>💡If you are using RSVP registrations you will not have any order confirmations</strong>--only <a href="622969-Tickets-Managing-Your-Orders-and-Attendees#attendee-list">attendee reports</a> from your <a href="510442-Event-Tickets-Using-RSVPs">RSVPs</a>.</p>

<h3 id="order-creation">Creation and completion of orders</h3>

<p>The whole process normally begins on the custom post type to which the tickets have been added (e.g. your event, page, or post). Customers add any number of tickets to the cart and continue on to pay for their order.</p>

<p>Normally--but not always--the onus is on the merchant (i.e. you or the site admin) to check the order before accepting or "completing" it and marking it as such.</p>

<p><strong>Using Event Tickets Plus with an e-commerce plugin:</strong></p>

<p>The actual process and terminology varies from plugin to plugin, so the best advice here is to check in with the vendor of your e-commerce plugin and read through their documentation for completing orders and accepting payments.</p>

<p>The important takeaway here, though, is that you should not assume tickets will be dispatched as soon as the customer is finished with the checkout process: most often, an extra step, will be required by the merchant (you!).</p>

<p><strong>The exception to this</strong> is if you are using the free RSVP ticket type; there are no order statuses or processes related to payment collection for the RSVP ticket type.</p>

<p><strong>If you want to have orders complete automatically once your attendee has paid</strong>, we recommend using WooCommerce and configuring it to only accept immediate forms of online payment. You can read more about how to set this up <a href="116479-Mark-orders-complete-automatically-in-WooCommerce">here</a>.</p>

<p>If you sell tickets using WooCommerce, then make sure you configure the Event Tickets Plus <a href="912714-WooCommerce-Specific-Ticket-Settings">WooCommerce Specific Settings</a> that will determine when the attendee records should be generated and the ticket emails be dispatched.</p>

<p><strong>Using Event Tickets and Tribe Commerce functionality:</strong></p>

<p>With Tribe Commerce, orders are created on the PayPal account and the information is sent to your site using PayPal IPN. Once received, the orders will show up in the orders page and ticket emails will be sent accordingly.</p>

<h3 id="attendee-list">Attendee list</h3>

<p>The attendee list is a consolidated list of all ticket purchases that have been made and completed for a given event (including RSVPs). There are a couple of ways in which you can navigate to this screen. The first is to hover over an event, page, or post in your WordPress admin and click on the <em>Attendees</em> link:</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><img alt="Attendee link in the main events list" src="https://s3.theeventscalendar.com/uploads/2014/11/attendees-665x185.png" /></p>

<p>The second is from within the <em>Tickets</em>&nbsp;meta box in the content editor:</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><img alt="View Attendees button within the Tickets meta box" src="https://s3.theeventscalendar.com/uploads/2018/03/View-Attendees-Button-in-Tickets-Editor.png" /></p>

<p style="text-align: center;">Classic Editor - View Attendees</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><img src="https://support.theeventscalendar.com/scripts/file.php%3Fview=Y&amp;file=6befcbba25768db36d6f5ddc472a19e7" /></p>

<p style="text-align: center;">Block Editor - View Attendees</p>

<p>Either link will take you to a new screen where you can see a list of attendees/issued tickets, including the purchaser name, email, ticket ID and a unique ticket security code:</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><img src="https://support.theeventscalendar.com/scripts/file.php%3Fview=Y&amp;file=7f47918381eb7d121816d6965b560a57" /></p>

<p>There are lots of interesting facets to this screen, but first, it's worth stopping for a moment to consider the order flow.</p>

<h3 id="order-statuses">Incomplete orders and unissued tickets</h3>

<p>What if tickets have been purchased but the orders have not yet been completed? Well, that would mean that the tickets have not been issued, and so they won't display on the attendee screen. Please note, that if you use WooCommerce, this will vary depending on your&nbsp;<a href="912714-WooCommerce-Specific-Ticket-Settings">WooCommerce Specific Settings</a>.</p>

<h3 id="navigating-attendees">Navigating the attendee screen</h3>

<p>Perhaps the next most important thing to pay attention to is the buttons located in the <strong>Check in</strong> column. The idea here is that when attendees arrive at your event, you can confirm that their ticket is valid and that a duplicate with the same ID has not already been checked in before admitting the person.</p>

<h4 id="qr-code-checkins">QR code check-ins</h4>

<p>If you have Event Tickets Plus installed and activated on your site, tickets will have a QR code on them. You can use these codes for in-person check-ins at your event; whether the ticket is being shown on a smartphone screen or is printed out on paper, scanning the QR code with any supported QR code reader will check in that attendee. Here's a screenshot of a ticket with a scannable QR code:</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://s3.theeventscalendar.com/uploads/2015/12/Screen-Shot-2015-12-02-at-12.59.45-PM.png"><img alt="Event Tickets Plus - QR Code Ticket" src="https://s3.theeventscalendar.com/uploads/2015/12/Screen-Shot-2015-12-02-at-12.59.45-PM.png" /></a><br />
An example of a QR code on a ticket sold with Event Tickets Plus.</p>

<p>You can get the full details on how to check in users with QR codes on <a href="668828-Using-QR-codes-with-Event-Tickets-Plus">this Knowledgebase article</a>.</p>

<h4 id="checkins-without-qr-codes">Check-ins without QR codes</h4>

<p>You can also check in users by simply clicking the <strong>Check in</strong> button next to each ticket in the event's Attendees page. When checking in attendees using this method, QR codes are not needed. In fact, you can even <a href="002538-Settings-overview-Event-Tickets-and-Event-Tickets-Plus">disable sending the QR code in the emailed tickets</a>.</p>

<p>If your event will be held in a location without reliable internet connectivity and you want to check in attendees "offline", you can export and print an attendee&nbsp;report using the directions provided <a href="622969-Tickets-Managing-Your-Orders-and-Attendees#exporting-attendees">in this article</a>. However, it's worth noting that <strong>offline check-ins won't benefit from the smart "already checked-in" feature</strong>, which may be relevant if you are checking in attendees at multiple locations for your venue.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://s3.theeventscalendar.com/uploads/2014/11/Attendee-Check-In-error-previously-checked-in.png" rel="attachment wp-att-1118814"><img alt="Attendee Check-In error - previously checked in" src="https://s3.theeventscalendar.com/uploads/2014/11/Attendee-Check-In-error-previously-checked-in-665x164.png" /></a><br />
Attendee check-in error: previously checked in</p>

<h4 id="attendee-info">Additional attendee information</h4>

<p>With Event Tickets Plus 4.1+, you can have your attendees fill out additional <a href="314750-Collecting-attendee-information">attendee information fields</a> whenever they buy a ticket or RSVP to an event. If you have added attendee information fields to any of your event tickets, you can find the data for each attendee by clicking the <strong>View details</strong> link on the attendee list.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><img alt="Attendee Information" src="https://s3.theeventscalendar.com/uploads/2018/08/Attendee-list-Attendee-Information.png" /> Attendee information being viewed in an Attendees report for an event.</p>

<p>In this example, customers were asked for their phone number, a T-shirt size, and whether they will require valet service at the event.</p>

<p>Different tickets for one event can have different attendee information settings, so the details for attendees may differ depending on what ticket type they bought or how much of the form they filled out.</p>

<p>If you want a full listing of all your attendee information, you can use the <strong>Export</strong> button to get a CSV file of all the data.</p>

<h4 id="exporting-attendees">Exporting attendee data</h4>

<p>Another key feature is that you can extract all of the attendee data by one of three different means: you can print to paper, email it, or export it as CSV data (which makes it easy to import into a spreadsheet application). You can find the complete selection of buttons at the top and bottom of each of your attendee lists.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://s3.theeventscalendar.com/uploads/2014/11/exporting.png"><img alt="exporting" src="https://s3.theeventscalendar.com/uploads/2014/11/exporting.png" /></a></p>

<h4 id="filters">Filtering the attendee list</h4>

<p>If you have lots of attendees, you'll also love the filtering options that are available for attendees lists:</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><img src="https://support.theeventscalendar.com/scripts/file.php%3Fview=Y&amp;file=8yfldzwhbetfvmyf6t3k3do9jvly83lc" /></p>

<p>Simply type in a ticket number (or just the start of one), and the list will be filtered to display only matching results. You can also filter your lists by order number, security code, order status, purchaser name, purchaser email or product ID.&nbsp;&nbsp;Order Status search is rather specific. For now, you have to enter the exact status name.</p>

<ul aria-autocomplete="list" aria-label="Write list…" aria-multiline="true" contenteditable="true" data-is-placeholder-visible="false" role="textbox">

		<li>Processing = processing</li>
		<li>Refunded = refunded</li>
		<li>Revoked = revoked</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="bulk-actions">Bulk Actions</h4>

<p>Similar to other WordPress admin pages, the attendee listing has some available bulk actions. Sometimes you want to check in lots of tickets all at once, or you might want to <em>reverse</em> that operation and undo the check-in for one or more attendees. You may even want to delete entries altogether or move attendees and RSVPs to another event. By checking the relevant rows and choosing a bulk action, you can perform any of these tasks quickly and painlessly.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://s3.theeventscalendar.com/uploads/2014/11/Screen-Shot-2016-12-22-at-3.29.53-PM.png"><img alt="screen-shot-2016-12-22-at-3-29-53-pm" src="https://s3.theeventscalendar.com/uploads/2014/11/Screen-Shot-2016-12-22-at-3.29.53-PM.png" /></a></p>

<p>Simply select your preferred action from the <strong>Bulk Actions</strong> drop-down menu, click the <strong>Apply</strong> button, and the action will be performed across the selected attendee items.</p>

<h4 id="rsvp-attendees">RSVP Attendees</h4>

<p>If your event uses the RSVP ticket type, viewing and managing RSVP attendees is handled in <strong>exactly the same manner</strong> as the above process. However, there is no "order status" for RSVP tickets.</p>

<hr />
<h3 id="editing-attendee-info">Letting attendees edit their information</h3>

<p>If you have Event Tickets Plus installed, as of version 4.2, you can choose to allow event attendees to log into your site and edit their RSVP/ticket information. If they reserved a certain meal type, for example, they can edit this to be another meal type if they've changed their minds.</p>

<p><strong>The ability to edit this information requires Event Tickets Plus—even for RSVPs.</strong></p>

<p>Follow these steps to allow users to view and modify their attendance responses:</p>

<p><strong>1. Allow user registration on your WordPress site.</strong><br />
First, you need to make sure that folks can make user accounts on your WordPress site. This is as simple as heading to Settings → General in your site's wp-admin and checking <a href="https://s3.theeventscalendar.com/uploads/2014/11/Screen-Shot-2016-06-03-at-1.15.04-PM.png" rel="noopener" target="_blank">the "Allow anyone to register" option</a>.</p>

<p>For more information on allowing user registration on your site, <a href="http://www.wpbeginner.com/beginners-guide/how-to-allow-user-registration-on-your-wordpress-site/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">this WPBeginner article</a> is an excellent resource.</p>

<p><strong>2. Limit RSVP and ticket purchase abilities to logged-in users.</strong><br />
Head to Events → Settings → Tickets in your site's wp-admin and locate the "Login" options on this panel. See the screenshot below and <a href="002538-Settings-overview-Event-Tickets-and-Event-Tickets-Plus#login" rel="noopener" target="_blank">this other Knowledgebase article</a> for more information on these options.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://s3.theeventscalendar.com/uploads/2014/11/Screen-Shot-2016-06-03-at-12.25.48-PM.png"><img alt="The Event Tickets Plus &quot;Login&quot; Options" src="https://s3.theeventscalendar.com/uploads/2014/11/Screen-Shot-2016-06-03-at-12.25.48-PM.png" /></a></p>

<p style="text-align: center;">"Login" options in Event Tickets Plus as of version 4.2 of the plugin.</p>

<p><strong>3. Let users RSVP or buy tickets like normal.</strong><br />
Once the settings above are configured as described, customers and visitors can come buy tickets and make RSVPs like normal, as long as they are logged into their account on your site.</p>

<p>Once they make their RSVP or purchase, though, any time they view the event online, they will see an information box about their RSVPs or tickets to the event. The information box shows below the venue information and above the ticket purchase form. Here's an example of how it looks:</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://s3.theeventscalendar.com/uploads/2014/11/Screen-Shot-2016-06-03-at-12.53.46-PM.png"><img alt="&quot;View your RSVPs&quot;" src="https://s3.theeventscalendar.com/uploads/2014/11/Screen-Shot-2016-06-03-at-12.53.46-PM.png" /></a><br />
An example of the "View your RSVPs" information box as of version 4.2 in Event Tickets Plus.</p>

<p>Clicking the <strong>View your RSVPs</strong> link (which will say <strong>View your Tickets</strong> if tickets were purchased) will lead the user to a page that looks something like this, depending on your theme:</p>

<p>On this page, they can change the following options for their RSVPs or tickets:</p>

<ul>
	<li>RSVP response</li>
	<li>name and email address associated with the ticket</li>
	<li><a href="314750-Collecting-attendee-information" rel="noopener" target="_blank">"Attendee Information" field</a> responses, if they exist</li>
	<li>whether or not the user wishes to be listed on the front-end "Who's Going?" list, if this feature is enabled on your site or events</li>
</ul>
